The world outside my window continues its indifferent rotation, while I remain trapped in this endless cycle of thought and doubt. What is the purpose of all this? Why do I continue to exist when my existence brings nothing but confusion and pain? The words I write tonight will be forgotten tomorrow, just as I will be forgotten when I am gone.

I remember the feel of sand between my toes, the taste of salt on my lips, the sound of seagulls crying overhead. These memories are more real to me than the room I sit in now.

I write these words as a promise to myself: I will survive this, and I will emerge stronger than before.
